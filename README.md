## **Motivation**
#### My eldest child was born on the same day as Olivia Engel, 6 year old victim in the Newtown, CT school shooting that occurred on December 14, 2012. Learning a child the exact same age as my own had died while simply attending school forever changed my life. My family has celebrated this child, who otherwise would have forever remained unknown to us, each year since her death. On or around their birthday, we participate in random acts of kindness in her memory. 

#### I have thought of Olivia countless times since that day in December of 2012. All the milestones my child has been fortunate enough to live to see, I have thought of her and her family, especially her mother. When my child returned to school from Christmas Break in January 2013; When 2nd grade was over; When elementary school was over; Middle school began; High school began.... Then this year, my child was fortunate enough to survive to graduate high school. I carried Olivia in my heart that day, especially as I watched my baby walk across the stage, and get their diploma. 

#### An actual lifetime has been lived while carrying the light of a child whose name I never should have known; Whose life was important, and whose death has thus far remained in vain as we have watched too many more school shootings happen, and far too many more children, simply attending school, lose their lives. 

#### For my capstone project, I wanted to analyze some data to see if the numbers I had tried not to think too much about over the last 12 years, the numbers representing people who've died in the U.S. from gun violence, are steadily increasing as I have feared is happening. My project attempts to show this data in a way that tells us whether or not gun violence has increased, decreased, or remained the same over the years. I hope the information proves useful to someone, and perhaps can be a step toward change that will help keep our children safe at school, and people in the U.S. safe in general, from gun violence.

## **Technologies**
#### I used Python 3, inside a Jupyter Notebook, and surprisingly did quite a bit of work in Microsoft Excel as well as creating a dashboard in Power BI. Most of the school shooting information was from [Capstone Public v3.1 K-12 School Shooting Database](https://k12ssdb.org/) which I was given permission to download June 1, 2024. Most of the information about other U.S. gun violence was downloaded from [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/) as CSV files and imported into either Jupyter or Excel for data cleaning and analyzing. I used Power BI to organize the data and create charts in an interactive dashboard.

## **Problems/Hurdles**
### So much data!
#### I initially planned to focus on data from 2013 and on, paying particular attention to U.S. gun violence since the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, CT. However, to my surprise, the Capstone Public School Shooting Database includes records on school shootings since 1966! I felt like I had to share all of the data, not just this 11-12 year period since Sandy Hook. I also did not originally intend to delve into school shooting data but there was so much of it, I couldn't avoid it.

### Yet, not enough data!
#### I wanted to break the data of shooting victims and shooters down by "typical" metrics like age, gender, race, etc. But I found that even with the vast number of csv files I had at my fingertips, that information was mostly not kept; Especially that of the race of shooters. I included what information I had, but it creates a visual that isn't necessarily accurate because too much data is not available.
